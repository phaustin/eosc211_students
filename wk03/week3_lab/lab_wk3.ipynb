    "1. Take a real world problem in EOAS and think of it like a scientific programmer\n",
    "2. Apply our knowledge of *Python* data types, indexing, slicing arrays\n",
    "3. Use built in functions and imported packages\n",
    "4. Generate a scientific figure with Matplotlib\n",
    "5. Reverse-engineer someone else's code to make it work for you\n",

    "### Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will apply our knowledge of *numpy arrays* to work with some real oceanographic data, as well as  generate a *scientific figure* using Python's *Matplotlib* library. Presenting your data with clear, concise, visually appealing figures is an exercise we will continually re-visit in this course, and will prove to be a useful skill throughout your career in EOAS. Below is a handy guide for creating excellent figures.\n",

It is highly recommended that you work through the tutorial **before** attempting the assignment, as it covers a few concepts we have not specifically addressed in lecture yet, and which are essential for earning full marks on the lab assignment."

The next thing to notice is that the file ends with `.mat`, which is the file extension used with data generated by MATLAB. To read this file into a jupyter notebook, we can use the built-in function `e211.load_mat()`. This function reads a `.mat` file and converts it into a numpy array. Similar functions exist for other data types like `.csv` (often used for spreadsheets), `.png` for images, `netCDF` files (outputs of climate models), `.shp/.shx/.dbf` (used for geographical information systems for programs like arcGIS)."

    "Much better! Now let's think about generating a way to label our X and Y axes with something meaningful. Currently, the labels refer to the *array index* of each point on our plot. A far more useful reference would be the latitude (on the y axis) and longitude (on the x axis). This particular image is from latitude 47$^o$ to 60$^o$ N and longitude -150$^o$ to -110 $^o$E. The following code generates arrays that with the lat and lon of each row and column in the image, then passes those into the `contourf` function, which then creates the plot with the new labels applied. Take a second to understand what is happening at each line of code. You may want to try running in a cell `help()` with the name of a built-in function for more information on how that function works."
