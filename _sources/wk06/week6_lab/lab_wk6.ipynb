    "It is often very useful to be able to *smooth* a time series to better display broad trends by averaging away the short-time variability. A simple, effective way of smoothing a time series is to use a *running mean*. Imagine that $N$ data points are recorded hourly, and number them 1,2,3,. . .,$i$−1, $i$, $i$ + 1,. . .,$N$ as they appear in an array. If we are calculating a 5 point running mean, then the 5th point in the *smoothed* time series will be the average of points 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 from the original time series (from “two-to-the-left” to “two-to-the-right”).  The 6th point in the smoothed time series will be the average of points 4, 5, 6, 7,and 8 from the original time series. The 7th point will be the average of points 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. And so on, moving over one point each time, with your window *running* through the time series, calculating the average of the points in the window at each point in the original series (Fig. 2).\n",

If we are going to take $L$ as a user-specified variable, what could you do to ensure that the $L$ used in your algorithm is indeed an odd number? (Multiple correct approaches) \n",

For example, set `x=[1 5 3 7 9 8 4 6]`, `winlen=3`, and work out BY HAND what the answer should be. Check to see if your program replicates the solution you worked out by hand. Try different window lengths and see what happens.\n",

    "## Part 3 - The Running Median and `while` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, your task is to add to/modify your code to calculate the *running median* instead of the *running mean* for a given window size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you use a running median instead of a running mean? For example for most temperature datasets, most (or all) of the data is correct, or at least not wildly and obviously wrong. This is generally untypical of \"real\" data, which often show very intermittent obviously erroneous measurements (outliers) for various reasons. The aircraft dataset contains such errors. We know that the speed of a plane tends to vary smoothly between something like 30 to 50 m/s, but there are strange spikes in the series (especially in the middle part of the time series when the plane is turning a lot), related to changes in the paths of radio-wave propagation when the aircraft changes its orientation and certain parts of the sky are obscured. These are clearly “bad data” because the speed of anything real won’t change by 20 m/s for only one second (the airplane's wings would fall off from the violent acceleration). Now, if  we  were  interested  in  the  speed,  taking  a  running  mean  will  not  really  help  matters because it tends to pull the smooth curve away from the “correct” points.   Because the median is more robust to outliers than the mean, the running  median can  reject  these outliers if the provided window length is long enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "A running median works much like a running mean, except that inside the window, we calculate the **median** of a dataset instead of the **mean**. For a refresher on *central tendencies of a dataset*, click [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/mean-median-basics/a/mean-median-and-mode-review). To calculate the median of a dataset:\n",

    ">3) Once your window only contains one number (the median) save it to the $i$th element of a new array which will contain your running median. \n",
    "\n",
    ">4) Move the window over and repeat. \n",
