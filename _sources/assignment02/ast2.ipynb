    "# Assignment 2 - Flybys\n",
    "# Spacecraft flybys of planets and moons.\n",
    "##  1. Assignment Overview\n",
    "This assignment is motivated by the use of flybys of planets / moons in spacecraft missions to alter a spacecraft’s trajectory (flight path). Planetary flybys can be used to not only change the direction of a spacecraft’s\n",
    "motion, but to also alter its speed. Such flybys are often referred to as “gravity assists” because the change to\n",
    "the spacecraft’s motion is enabled by the gravitational force of the planet on the spacecraft. For example, missions to the outer solar system typically use the gravity of Jupiter to provide a “boost” to the spacecraft’s speed,\n",
    "such that the spacecraft can actually make it to the outer solar system. In contrast, missions to the inner solar system typically use the gravity field of one or more planets to slow the spacecraft down enough that it can\n",
    "go into orbit around the desired planet. A good resource describing planetary gravity assists can be found [here](https://www.planetary.org/articles/20130926-gravity-assist).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will construct a simplified planetary flyby. The simplifications are that we assume an otherwise “straight-line” path of the spacecraft (rather than starting with an elliptical orbit around the sun, or a hyberbolic trajectory into the outer solar system), and we assume that the planet is stationary during the flyby (in practice the planet is of course in an elliptical orbit around the Sun). In the assignment we will draw on much of what we have learned in the course to implement a numerical integration algorithm using python to compute a spacecraft’s acceleration, velocity and position as it flys by a planet. The assignment will also demonstrate how you can use python to produce numerical solutions to problems for which there is no simple analytical solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Coding Overview\n",
    "For this assignment you will write 4 functions and call them with several `main()` functions. The functions are as follows:\n",
    "- The guts of your code will be a function `get_traj()` that will return the acceleration, velocity and position vectors along the complete spacecraft trajectory. `get_traj()` will call three subfunctions `gravacc(), update_sc_vel_pos(), and checkinit()`.\n",
    "- `gravacc()` will calculate the gravitational acceleration on the spacecraft at any given point along the trajectory.\n",
    "- `update_sc_vel_pos()` will compute the instantaneous change in position and velocity of the spacecraft due to the gravitational acceleration caused by the planet.  \n",
    "- `checkinit()` will check that your initial spacecraft velocity and position are feasible.\n",
    "- The `main()` script(s) will call `get_traj() `for various initial (starting) conditions that I will give you. The main script(s) will contain the code to generate the requested figures or output in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANT POINTS:\n",
    "1. The use of SI units is ESSENTIAL to this assignment. Make sure to convert ALL your length, mass and time variables into m, kg and seconds before doing any calculations. For plotting purposes it is more useful to use km, so convert m to km only for plotting.\n",
    "2. The amount of code required for this assignment is not huge. For example, my version of `get_traj` contains only 13 lines of code and the subfunctions `gravacc`, `update_sc_vel_pos`, and `checkinit` contain 5, 3 and 3 lines of code respectively, not including comment and help lines. However, you should be vigilent about being consistent in your use of variable names, and in not generating unecessary variables, otherwise your code (and thinking!) will get out of hand.\n",
    "3. Make sure your code is organized into easily readable, compact coding “blocks”, with appropriate comment lines, and separated by white space.\n",
    "4. All functions must contain doc strings.\n",

    "We have a spacecraft which is about to fly past a planet or moon. We will simplify the problem and look at it in a cartesian (x,y) geometry. The origin of our coordinate system is at the center of the planet (see Figure 1). The spacecraft motion is such that if the planet was not there, the spacecraft would be flying with constant velocity in the positive y-direction. Our spacecraft starts out with this velocity at some distance from the planet (bottom of Figure 1). Far away from the planet the spacecraft has constant velocity (remember Newton’s second law: no net force on the spacecraft implies constant momentum ($m \\vec{v}$), and so constant velocity). As the spacecraft approaches the planet, it experiences a gravitational force due to the planet. The position vector, $\\vec{s}$ has both $x$ and $y$ components, so $\\vec{s}=s_{x} \\hat{x}+s_{y} \\hat{y}$.

    "## 6. Numerical Convergence: Starting Conditions and Time Step\n",
    "1. Explore what happens to the closest approach altitude, when you change the y-coordinate of the initial position ($s_{y0}$).  Print a 2-column output that gives the $s_{y0}$ coordinate in $R_p$ and closest approach altitude in km for $s_{y0}$ equal to $-3R_p$, and then for 9 additional values of $s_{y0}$, each one set to be double the previous value.  Do this in a loop, doubling the $s_{y0}$ value in each iteration. Each time you double $s_{y0}$ you should double $t_f$. (After you have your loop working you can check out what happens if you don’t double $t_f$ ...). You should find that as you increase the distance of the initial $s_{y0}$ coordinate from the planet, the closest approach altitude decreases. The decrease is large initially but then gets smaller as the closest approach altitude converges towards a stable answer. What has happened is that although we had set up the algorithm for the numerical integration properly, the initial conditions were incorrect. To accurately assess how close the spacecraft will get to the planet, we need to start our calculation with the spacecraft far enough away from the planet that the gravitational force on the spacecraft due to the planet is negligible. Our initial guess at a starting position of $s_{y0}$ of $-3 R_p$ is not far enough since the gravitational force only falls off as 1 /(distance)$^2$ . You’ll see that an initial value of more than $-300 R_p$ is needed! However, there is also another issue that you’ll now investigate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint 1 - depending how you are handling your initial conditions input arguments to get_traj, you may find it helpful to use `copy.deepcopy` to make copies of the initial condition variable so that you can update it without affecting your original values.  You need to `import copy`, then if e.g. your initial conditions are stored in one variable called init_cond, the syntax to make a copy is `init_cond2 = copy.deepcopy(init_cond)`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint 2 - displaying your 2-column output: A pandas data frame is quite handy for this.  You can index the closest approach altitudes in the table using the initial position y-coordinate variable $s_{y0}$*. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up another simulation: Set the $s_{y0}$ variable to be $s_{y0} =  -96 R_p$. (Although it should be larger, this would result in the computations taking longer.) Set the total time, $t_f$ to be 1280 minutes. Set up another variable $a_\\mathrm{target}$ for the target closest approach altitude. Set this altitude to be 195 km.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now investigate the effect of the time increment $(\\Delta t)$ used in the numerical integration. Start with $\\Delta t = 60$  seconds, compute the spacecraft trajectory, then halve the value of $\\Delta t$ used. Continue until the closest approach altitude $a_c$ is within 2% of the target altitude, that is until the percentage error $100*(a_c - a_\\mathrm{target})/a_\\mathrm{target}$ falls just below 2. This is best done using a `while` loop. Use `time.perf_counter()` to measure the elapsed time for each $\\Delta t$. You’ll see that the computation time scales with the number of time steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In Figure 3, make 2 subplots. In the top one show the percentage error in the closest approach altitude as a function of 1/$\\Delta t$. You should see smooth convergence of the results toward the desired target altitude, but at increasing computational expense. In fact, in our case the results converge only to within about 2% of the target altitude, because to converge more closely to the actual target altitude you would also need to use an initial $s_{y0}$ position futher from the planet. In the lower figure plot the percentage error versus $\\Delta t$, and label your plot with the final $\\Delta t$ needed to reach the 2% error criterion above, and the computation time for that ∆t. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "5. This concept of convergence is fundamental to numerical techniques. What you saw above is that in our case two parameters are important, the initial position of the spacecraft with respect to the planet and the time increment, $\\Delta t$. In the first exercise you saw that successively doubling the distance of the y-coordinate $s_{y0}$ led to a decrease in the altitude of closest approach, and furthermore that as you got further away from the planet the answer (closest approach distance) changed less. In this case the solution was converging (meaning that eventually as we moved even further away the answer would no longer change). However, it was not converging to the right answer. This was because the time interval, $\\Delta t$ was too long. An implicit assumption in our numerical integration is that over the time interval $\\Delta t$ the gravitational force on the spacecraft remains constant. However in 60 seconds the spacecraft travels approximately 7$*$60 km = 420 km. When the spacecraft is close to the planet the gravitational force changes substantially over this time increment. Thus decreasing the the time increment increases the accuracy of the calculations. In practice we have found that we need to start a long way from the planet (more than 300 Mercury radii) and use a short time increment. This results in a computationally intensive calculation, and most of the calculations are not needed because they are being done at short time intervals while we are very far away from the planet. Can you think of a way to choose the time stepping to speed things up while retaining the accuracy needed? Write one or two sentences (3 max) on how you might do this.  \n",
