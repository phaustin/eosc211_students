    "**We have a record of speeds for a moving object (say, a drifter). We  want to see how long the object moves at a constant speed. In particular, we want to write code which will measure the length of time that the speed is less than `maxspd` and greater than `minspd` (call this a “run”). For example, if the speeds are stored in an array: `spd = np.array([5 1 5 5 5 10 5 1 5 5 5 1 2 2 5])` with `minspd=4` and `maxspd=6`, then we have 3 runs of length 1 and 2 runs of length 3, with no other runs. We would want to store this information in another variable in which the i$^{th}$ value was the number of runs of length i, i.e.:**\n",
