    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is about using functions and modules to keep code organized even when the data analysis gets large and complex. So far, we have been mostly concerned with the finer details of python syntax and the building blocks that make up the language. Learning a programming language is not that different than learning a spoken language -- now that we have mastered the A,B,C's and can put words together to form sentences, it's time to scale up and write a bona-fide essay. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometime soon in your EOSC career, you will be asked to complete a project that requires analysis of a dataset and a subsequent report of your techniques and the conclusions you draw from your research. More often than not, the person to whom you submit your report is much more interested in the \"science,\" and less interested in nitty-gritty bits of code you used to get there. (They might be less well-versed in python, or maybe they don't speak code at all!) Your analysis should therefore contain only the few lines of code needed illustrate where you got your data, the steps taken to process it, and a scientific figure which effectively communicates the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great way to accomplish this is to implement the majority of your code in a *function module*, a separate python program that contains the functions you created to accomplish your analysis, and a *main script* which contains your only minimalist code cells that call functions imported from your library, and to accompany this with some written exposition on the topic at hand."

    "1. Functions should be small (usually less than 20 lines of code)\n",
    "2. They should do one thing (Single Responsibility Principle)\n",
    "3. Function argument lists should be limited to at most 4-5 variables\n",
    "4. Function names should say what they do,and should be resemble verbs if possible\n",
    "   (\"calc_mean\", \"write_file\", \"read_data\")\n",
    "5. Functions should avoid \"side effects\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   An example of a side effect: modifying a variable that has been passed to a function without returning\n",
    "   that variable.  This kind of hidden action makes it difficult for a reader quickly determine\n",
    "   what a function does.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Following these rules make it much easier to understand and debug a program.\n",

For example, for a window size of 3, the 9 points within a 3 ×3 square surrounding the data point are averaged together.
