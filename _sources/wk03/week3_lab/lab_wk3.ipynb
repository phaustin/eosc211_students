    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a real world problem in EOAS and think of it like a scientific programmer\n",
    "2. Apply our knowledge of *Python* data types, indexing, slicing arrays\n",
    "3. Use built in functions and imported packages\n",
    "4. Generate a scientific figure with Matplotlib\n",
    "5. Reverse-engineer someone else's code to make it work for you\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will apply our knowledge of *numpy arrays* to work with some real oceanographic data, as well as  generate a *scientific figure* using Python's *Matplotlib* library. Presenting your data with clear, concise, visually appealing figures is an exercise we will continually re-visit in this course, and will prove to be a useful skill throughout your career in EOAS. Below is a handy guide for creating excellent figures.\n",

    "<b>Scientific Figure Checklist:</b> \n",

    "- [ ] Title (Short and sweet is best)\n",
    "- [ ] Axes labels with units (Don't forget the units!)\n",
    "- [ ] Legend (Or anything that helps interpret the information presented)\n",
    "- [ ] Does the figure *make sense* just by looking at it? The data should be clear without referencing anything outside the figure\n",
    "- [ ] Does it *look good*? (Do the colors clash? does it look crowded/messy?)\n",

    "This lab is comprised of two sections: **1)** a tutorial for processing data with Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and creating a scientific figure with Matplotlib, and **2)** a set of instructions for creating your own figure which you will hand in. It is highly recommended that you work through the tutorial **before** attempting the assignment, as it covers a few concepts we have not specifically addressed in lecture yet, and which are essential for earning full marks on the lab assignment."

So far we know we will be dealing with *numpy arrays* and making plots, so lets import Numpy and Matplotlib. There are a few different syntaxes for importing packages, demonstrated below:"

To read this file into a jupyter notebook, we can use the built-in function `e211.load_mat()`. This function reads a `.mat` file and converts it into a numpy array. Similar functions exist for other data types like `.csv` (often used for spreadsheets), `.png` for images, `netCDF` files (outputs of climate models), `.shp/.shx/.dbf` (used for geographical information systems for programs like arcGIS)."
