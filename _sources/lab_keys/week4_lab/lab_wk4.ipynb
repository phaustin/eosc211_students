    "Below are the hydrostatic equations. They relate *atmospheric pressure* and *density* to height above sea level. The pressure and air density conditions we measure at the surface are due to the weight of the atmosphere above being pulled down by Earth's gravity. As we move higher into the atmosphere, there is less air above us (less weight pushing down), so the pressure decreases, as does the density (less pressure = less force squeezing the air molecules together). For air pressure $P$, we can express this as a mathematical function:\n",

    "* Be very careful with unit conversion.  Humans usually like to express temperature in Celsius, but the thermodynamic equations require temperatures in Kelvin.  That means that you need to distinguish between two temperatures with names like `Tk` and `Tc`, where `Tk = Tc + 273.15`. Make sure that you convert to Kelvin as soon as you can. Do it only once at the start and (if necessary for output) once at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose good variable names. Don’t use single letters like `T` and `P` for variable names in a script. It makes it very hard to do search and replace with your editor when you want to change them, and the names aren’t very meaningful to others who might read your code. Remember that Python is *case sensitive* so `P` and `p` are two different variables. Also, it is super helpful to note the units of each variable with comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As much as you can, separate your script into 4 parts IN THIS ORDER:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**1.  INPUTS:**  These  are  variables  whose  values  you  might  want  to  change  if  you  run  the  program multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**2.  INTERNAL DEFINITIONS or CONSTANTS:** These are variables that are defined as constants which you will never change, or some simple conversions (e.g. Celsius to Kelvin)\n",
    "\n",
    ">**3.  CALCULATIONS:** This is where the complicated parts of the procedure go\n",
    "\n",
    ">**4.  OUTPUTS:** What you do once the math is finished (e.g. plotting).\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is useful to separate the parts by white space, and liberally comment your code. You can also separate each of these four parts into individual cells in a Jupyter Notebook, so you can run them individually, one at a time. Note that not all tasks in 2 and 3 are easily separated, and sometimes plotting happens earlier than the end of the program, but it’s a good idea to always approach problems this way initially.\n",
