    "### A few FAQ / comments about *args\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\.  What is the `*` doing in `def trans2(*args1):`?  The `*` or `splat` can be thought of as an operator.  It is operating on the function arguments and returning a tuple called `args1`:  see the output of  `print(f\"{type(args1)=}\")`\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\.  We made `args2` a list of 2D arrays.  The function returns this which is then \"unpacked\" into the individual variables `B1`, `B2`, `B3` and `B4`.  This communicates to someone reading the code that you expect\n",
    "exactly 4 items in the args2 list returned by trans2, and that you want to work with them as individual variables.\n",
    "Python will raise a ValueError if the length of args2 is not 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. One thing to remember is that tuple creation and unpacking is handled by the comma operator, so e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "    a = 1,2,3  # packs or creates the tuple, a\n",
    "    x,y,z = a  # unpacks `a` into x,y,z; also called multiple assignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\.  We've seen this tangentially before in references to multiple assignment in for loops. The last ref on the list above is really helpful in covering tuple, list unpacking and packing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "person_dictionary = {'name': \"CJ\", 'university': \"UBC\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# one dictionary item at a time print key and value\n",
    "print(f\"Loop over items\")\n",
    "for item in person_dictionary.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"Key {item[0]} has value {item[1]}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Same thing but with multiple assignment (like multiple assignment with = operator)\n",
    "print(f\"\\nMultiple assignment loop\")\n",
    "for key, value in person_dictionary.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"Key {key} has value {value}\")\n",
    "```    \n",
    "</br> \n",
    "\n",
    "5\\.  Phil says:  \"Handling an arbitrary number of function arguments is definitely useful, but in my own code I don't find myself using it very often, since I'd like the function signature to be as specific as possible.    I use kw expansion much more often, because all the keywords are specified in the function signature, and the creator of the dictionary that's going into `my_fun(**kw_dict)` knows what they put into the dictionary.  So you get the best of both worlds -- much less typing when you call the function, but complete documentation when you read the function signature.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. A couple basic rules for function signatures:\n",
    "\n",
    "a\\) Your function should do something useful even if no optional arguments are supplied. That is, optional keyword\n",
    "   arguments should really be optional  \n",
    "b\\) You should try to keep your required arguments down to between 4-5 -- the number that fit into\n",
    "   short term human memory.   If you need more than that, then use a dictionary that can \n",
    "   contain the required arguments and require that instead."
