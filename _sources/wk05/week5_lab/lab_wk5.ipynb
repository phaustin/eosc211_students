    "\n",
    "This lab will focus on applying some of the new concepts we have learned to work with data very similar to what we have seen before. This week's dataset is a *digital elevation model* (DEM) and your challenge is to write a program for the analysis of topographic slopes. Usually datasets are not provided with slopes, instead elevation data are stored in a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which is basically a large array containing elevation above some datum (usually sea level) over a grid of points. You already saw a DEM in the lab for Week 3, though we didn’t call it by that name. The program you write let a \"user\" pick a point on a plot of the DEM, then calculate the slope at that point, and use formatted text to tell you whether that point is east-facing, west-facing, or relatively flat. Your code will have to take into account that the world is round if you select a point on the edge of the DEM. A useful way of writing this kind of program is to proceed in a few steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Break up the problem into parts.   One technique useful for programs handling a lot of ‘special cases’ is to make it work for only one of the cases as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this case we won’t make you start from scratch - instead you will work through code we have given you to get you started making sure you understand what each line does, Then you have to add a piece of code that does the right thing if the input data is ‘good’.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then, think about ways in which the input data can be ‘bad’.  Add code to test for these conditions and to handle them in a useful way. This code will often get squeezed into the middle of the existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",

However the 360 degrees of longitude are not represented as twice the length of the 180 degrees of latitude. While not strictly necessary, we can fix this visualization next time we plot with ```plt.axis('equal')```.
