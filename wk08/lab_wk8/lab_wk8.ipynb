    "**Objectives:** This week's lab is about writing code that is reuseable, efficient and well-organized. How do we do this? Functions! The objective here is to take code from week 6 and re-package it in a better, more pythonic style. We will then test the code with a couple of datasets for the lab to make sure it can handle a range of input types and user-specified parameters, while still getting the right answer.\n",
